# Traycer - AI-Powered Development Planning

A modern web application that serves as a planning layer on top of coding agents, inspired by the concept of Traycer. This application provides an intuitive interface for managing development tasks, coordinating AI agents, and visualizing project progress.

## 🚀 Features

### Core Functionality
- **Task Management**: Create, edit, and track development tasks with priorities and dependencies
- **Agent Coordination**: Manage AI agents with different specializations (Frontend, Backend, Full-stack, DevOps, AI/ML)
- **Planning Interface**: Visualize project progress with multiple view modes (Kanban, Timeline, Dependencies)
- **Real-time Updates**: Track agent status and task progress in real-time

### Advanced Features
- **Dependency Management**: Visualize task dependencies and critical path analysis
- **Agent Efficiency Tracking**: Monitor agent performance and workload distribution
- **Multiple View Modes**: Switch between Kanban board, timeline, and dependency graph views
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Power user features with keyboard navigation
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices

### UI/UX Improvements
- **Modern Design**: Clean, intuitive interface with smooth animations
- **Status Indicators**: Visual status indicators for tasks and agents
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress bars and completion metrics
- **Interactive Elements**: Hover effects, smooth transitions, and micro-interactions

## 🎯 Key Concepts

### Planning Layer Architecture
Traycer acts as a planning layer that sits on top of coding agents, providing:
- **Task Orchestration**: Breaking down complex projects into manageable tasks
- **Agent Coordination**: Assigning tasks to appropriate agents based on capabilities
- **Progress Monitoring**: Tracking completion and identifying bottlenecks
- **Dependency Management**: Ensuring tasks are completed in the correct order

### Agent Types
- **Frontend Agent**: Specialized in React, TypeScript, CSS, UI/UX
- **Backend Agent**: Focused on APIs, databases, server-side logic
- **Full-stack Agent**: Capable of both frontend and backend development
- **DevOps Agent**: Infrastructure, deployment, CI/CD pipelines
- **AI/ML Agent**: Machine learning, AI integration, data processing

### Task Lifecycle
1. **Pending**: Task created but not assigned
2. **In Progress**: Assigned to an agent and being worked on
3. **Completed**: Task finished and reviewed
4. **Blocked**: Task cannot proceed due to dependencies or issues

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

### User Experience
- **Intuitive Navigation**: Clear information hierarchy and logical flow
- **Visual Feedback**: Immediate response to user actions
- **Efficiency**: Keyboard shortcuts and bulk operations
- **Accessibility**: Semantic HTML and keyboard navigation

### Visual Design
- **Modern Aesthetics**: Clean, minimal design with subtle shadows and borders
- **Consistent Spacing**: Systematic use of spacing and typography
- **Color Coding**: Meaningful use of color for status and priority
- **Responsive Layout**: Adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **LLM Integration**: AI-powered task suggestions and agent recommendations
- **Real-time Collaboration**: Multi-user support with live updates
- **Advanced Analytics**: Detailed project metrics and insights
- **Integration APIs**: Connect with external tools and services
- **Custom Agent Types**: User-defined agent specializations
- **Automated Testing**: Built-in testing and quality assurance

### Technical Improvements
- **Performance Optimization**: Virtual scrolling and lazy loading
- **Offline Support**: Progressive Web App capabilities
- **Advanced State Management**: Redux or Zustand integration
- **Testing Suite**: Comprehensive unit and integration tests
- **Documentation**: Interactive API documentation
